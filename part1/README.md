# part1: Introduction to React

This folder contains submissions for Part 1 of the Full Stack Open.
See their individual `README`s for more information.
More or less they've all been bootstrapped using `create-react-app`,
so running them would just be a simple `npm start`.
(The course material chooses not to use `yarn start`.)
