# fullstackopen

My submission for the [Full Stack Open 2020 MOOC](https://fullstackopen.com/) by the [University of Helsinki's Department of Computer Science](https://www.mooc.fi/en).

## Hierarchy and usage

To clone the entire repository, run the following:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/janreggie/fullstackopen.git
```

Note the `--recursive` flag since all the projects here are "submodules" from my other repositories.
