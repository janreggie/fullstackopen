# fullstackopen

My submission for the [Full Stack Open 2020 MOOC](https://fullstackopen.com/) by the [University of Helsinki's Department of Computer Science](https://www.mooc.fi/en).

## Hierarchy and usage

Each folder `partX` contains the finished output for that part. Note that there will be a lot of code duplication in this code since I had to rely on manually copying the project from the previous part to the next once the latter parts require building on top of them.

Each project `partX/proj` can be launched by running `npm install && npm start`.
